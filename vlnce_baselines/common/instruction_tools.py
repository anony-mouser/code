# prompt_template = f"""Parse a navigation instruction delimited by triple quotes and your task is to perform the following actions:
# 1. Extract Destination: Understand the entire instruction and summarize a description of the destination. The description should be a sentence containing landmark and roomtype.
# 2. Split instructions: Split the instruction into a series of sub-instructions according to the execution steps. Each sub-instruction contain one landmark.
# 3. Infer agent's state constraints: Infer the state constraints that the agent should satisfy for each sub-instruction. There're thee constraint types: location constraints, diretion constraints, object constraints. You need to select an appropriate constraint type and give the corresponding constraint object. Direction constraint object has two types: left, right. Constraints can format as a tuple: (constraint type, constraint object)
# 4. Make a decision: Analyze the landmarks, actions, and directions in each sub-instruction to determine how the agent should act. For a landmark, the agent has three options: approach, move away, or approach and then move away. For direction, the agent has three options: turn left, turn right, or go forward
# Provide your answer in JSON format with the following details:
# 1. use the following keys: destination, sub-instructions, state-constraints, decisions
# 2. the value of destination is a string
# 3. the value of sub-instructions is a list of all sub-instructions
# 4. the value of state-constraints is a JSON. The key is index start from zero and the value is a list of all constraints, each constraint is a tuple
# 5. the value of decisions is a nested JSON. The first level JSON's key is index start from zero and it;s value is second level JONS with keys: landmarks, directions. The value of landmarks is a list of tuples, each tuple contains (landmark, action). The value of directions is a list of direction choice for each sub-instruction.
# An Example:
# User: "exit exercise room to living room, turn slight left, walk behind couch, turn right and walk behind couch, turn left into dining room. Stop next to 2 chairs at glass table."
